# SetPriority
Mod that allows players to set priority of Minecraft process once

# Prepositions
I and my friends wanted to play Minecraft 1.12.2 with Forge installed. After assembling a modpack we ran into following situation: when a modpack tester started playing mouse started to stutter and lag despite overall high fps. After some manipulations (and googling) we discovered that lowering process priority in task manager helps to solve that problem. So i wrote a mod that will set priority on each start of Minecraft process.
